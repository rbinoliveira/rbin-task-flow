- **Rubinho Task Flow - Interactive Task Management:**
  - This project uses **Rubinho Task Flow** for task tracking and management
  - Access via interactive menu: `./rubinho-task-flow.sh`
  - Tasks are defined in plain text: `.task-flow/tasks.txt`
  - Task data is stored in: `.task-flow/scripts/` (do not edit directly)

- **Task Definition:**
  - Edit `.task-flow/tasks.txt` to define tasks
  - Use simple format: `- [ ] Task description`
  - AI will generate detailed subtasks from descriptions
  - Keep descriptions clear and actionable

- **Interactive Menu Options:**
  1. **Generate tasks** - AI transforms tasks.txt into detailed subtasks
  2. **View status** - See all tasks and their completion progress
  3. **View details** - Get detailed instructions for a specific task
  4. **Mark as done** - Update subtask completion status
  5. **Edit tasks.txt** - Open editor to add/modify tasks

- **Workflow Example:**
  ```markdown
  1. Add tasks to `.task-flow/tasks.txt`:
     - [ ] Implement user authentication
     - [ ] Add database migrations
     - [ ] Create API endpoints

  2. Run: ./rubinho-task-flow.sh
  3. Select option 1 to generate detailed subtasks
  4. Select option 2 to view all tasks and progress
  5. Select option 3 to view specific task details
  6. Work on the tasks following the AI-generated instructions
  7. Select option 4 to mark subtasks as done when completed
  ```

- **Commit Workflow:**
  - After completing tasks, follow [commit_practices.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/commit_practices.mdc)
  - Never execute git commands directly - follow [git_control.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/git_control.mdc)
  - Suggest commits with descriptive messages referencing completed tasks

- **Commit Message Format:**
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "feat(module): Complete tasks from Rubinho Task Flow

  - Task 1: [description]
  - Task 2: [description]

  Completed via Rubinho Task Flow"
  ```

- **Integration with Other Rules:**
  - Follow [commit_practices.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/commit_practices.mdc) for commit format
  - Follow [git_control.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/git_control.mdc) - NEVER execute git, only suggest
  - See `CLAUDE.md` for complete Rubinho Task Flow documentation
  - See `README.md` for installation and setup instructions

- **Best Practices:**
  - Keep task descriptions concise but clear
  - Let AI generate detailed implementation steps
  - Review generated subtasks before starting work
  - Update task status regularly through the menu
  - Commit work frequently referencing task progress

- **Principle:**
  > **Use Rubinho Task Flow's interactive menu for all task management. Define tasks in plain text, let AI generate details, track progress through the menu, and commit work with descriptive messages.**
